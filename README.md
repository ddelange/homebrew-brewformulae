# ddelange/brewformulae

My [tap](https://docs.brew.sh/Taps) repo for brew formulae.


## How do I install these formulae?

In one line: `brew install ddelange/brewformulae/<formula>`

Or `brew tap ddelange/brewformulae` and then `brew install <formula>`.


## Documentation

`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).

This repo was generated with `brew tap-new`.

Tip: this GitHub repo was briefly called `homebrew-brewformulae`, as brew looks for this prefix. However, renaming instates an internal redirect, so brew will pick it up despite not having the `homebrew-` prefix.
